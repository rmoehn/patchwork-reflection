# But actually I wanted a different scenario. → reflected-locked-pointer-2.txt
# Where the unresolved pointer is not also one of the sub-question answers.
# Then it should be fine to pass it, but not to unlock it.

# → shows a modification to clarify that pointers in reflected contexts can't be
# unlocked. In this case it allows us to maintain the textual association
# between the two occurrences of the same pointer.
